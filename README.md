# ListUserReact
Beside that, you need to create some feature like:
1.	If I click on any role in the sidebar (on the left side of the screen), I can retrieve the list of users by calling the API. The user information will then be displayed as a user card on the right side of the screen.
  Here are the APIs available for each role:
  a.	For Developer:
  https://randomuser.me/api/?results=40&seed=dev
  b.	For Tester:
  https://randomuser.me/api/?results=40&seed=test
  c.	For Business Analysis:
  https://randomuser.me/api/?results=40&seed=ba
  d.	For Manager:
  https://randomuser.me/api/?results=40&seed=manager

2.	On the right side of the screen, you can search by typing the desired search key into the input field. You can search through the Name or Email of the user list, which is referred to as feature 1. 

3.	Additionally, we can filter users by gender by selecting Male or Female from the dropdown list located on the right side of the screen.
